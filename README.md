## Question 1: In 300 words write up on the difference between the 7 layers OSI reference model and the TCP/IP model

•	The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes and defines the functions of networking and communication systems. It is divided into distinct layers, each responsible for a specific set of functions. 
•	The Physical layer, the lowest layer, deals with the actual physical transmission of bits over the network medium. It encompasses the cables, switches and network adapters, focusing on electrical and mechanical specifications. 
•	The Data Link Layer builds upon the Physical layer by providing data and framing for error detection. It is further divided into Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC) sublayers.

•	Network layer is responsible for routing packets from the source to the destination, often using IP addresses. It acts as bridge between the data link and transport layers. 
•	The Transport layer manages end-to-end communication, ensuring data is reliable transmitted between devices. Two primary protocols in this layer are TCP and UDP, offering connection-oriented and connectionless services, respectively.

•	The Session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between devices. It manages dialog control and synchronization, allowing data exchange between applications.
•	The Presentation layer focuses on data translation and encryption. It ensures that data is presented in a readable format for the application layer, performing tasks like data compression and encryption.

•	Finally, the application layer is the topmost layer and is responsible for interacting with end-user application. It provides services for email, file transfers, remote access and more.

•	The primary differences among these layers are their functions and the level at which they operate. Lower layers deal with hardware and basic transmission, while higher layers focus on data manipulation and application interactions. Each layer plays a vital role in the end-to-end communication process, making the OSI model a fundamental tool for understanding network architecture and troubleshooting connectivity issues.
